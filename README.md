# Stroke Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the likelihood of a stroke in patients using clinical and demographic data. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early identification of high-risk individuals, enabling timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.

## Features

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Multiple machine learning models implemented and compared (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
* Model evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
* Deployment-ready predictive pipeline

## Dataset

The project uses the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle, which contains patient information including:

* Age
* Gender
* Hypertension status
* Heart disease status
* Marital status
* Work type
* Residence type
* Average glucose level
* BMI
* Smoking status
* Stroke occurrence (target variable)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stroke-prediction.git
   cd stroke-prediction
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main notebook or script to train and evaluate the models:

```bash
jupyter notebook Stroke_Prediction.ipynb
```

or

```bash
python stroke_prediction.py
```

## Model Performance

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.85     | 0.80      | 0.75   | 0.77     | 0.83    |
| Random Forest       | 0.88     | 0.85      | 0.78   | 0.81     | 0.86    |
| XGBoost             | 0.89     | 0.86      | 0.80   | 0.83     | 0.88    |
